## Overview

Eric Graham's original 1987 Juggler Raytracer 1.0 source code and related data

This is the same data archived on archive.org at https://archive.org/details/raytracer-1987-graham-source-code.adf.-7z

I have extracted the ADF into portable files using my Python port ( https://github.com/AlphaPixel/Extract-ADF-Python ) of Extract ADF ( https://github.com/mist64/extract-adf ). I had OpenAI Codex create the Python port specifically for this task.

Ernie Wright also has copies of some of the files but his web site:
http://www.etwright.org/cghist/juggler.html

links to this copy of the ADF: https://www.dottyflowers.com/index.php?file=home&module=blog&page=viewpost&post=raytracer-1_0-%28plus-source%29

which is no longer live.

Since it's hard to actually find the textual C source online, I resolved to archive it here on GitHub for future programmers to learn and appreciate their history.

I contacted Eric Graham on Feb 10, 2026 to request permission to redistribute the code.

> *I was hoping to put the code onto GitHub for posterity, and I realized there is no explicit license, or copyright release on the code. I'm wondering if you'd be willing to specifically declare a license or a release of copyright so it would be legitimate on GitHub.*

Eric replied the same day with
> *Yes, I'd be happy to! It is ironic to be most known for something that I did in a day! As far as I am concerned anyone can do what they want with the code, so long as I get a mention!*

So, by Eric's directive, it is now declared under Public Domain, with an Attribution clause, which shouldn't be hard to abide by. I can't imagine anyone WOULDN'T want to acknowledge the contribution of Eric and his  Juggler and raytracing work which literally altered the careers and lives of many of us who saw it and saw the whole computing universe change in an instant. I have had a career in computer graphics because Juggler sold me on buying an Amiga.

For thoroughness, I will also catalog several other Juggler resources here:

## Modernization

The modernization work needed a way to run the original 1987 Amiga raytracer on current Windows, Linux, and macOS systems while keeping the source relationship to the published code clear. The main missing secret sauce is the Amiga OS and chipset display environment used by `rt3.c`.

The chosen approach was to minimally update the renderer source and leave the Amiga-facing display calls in place, then provide a small SDL3 compatibility layer that implements only the Amiga functions and types this program uses.

### Approach

The port adds local Amiga-style headers under `src/exec/` and `src/intuition/` so as not to alter the includes in `rt3.c`. These headers define the minimal types, structures, constants, and function prototypes needed by the original source. The intent is not to reproduce the full Amiga API. It is only enough interface for this program to compile and run.

The display implementation lives in `src/emulate-amiga.c`. It provides functions such as `OpenLibrary()`, `OpenScreen()`, `OpenWindow()`, `CloseWindow()`, `ViewPortAddress()`, `SetRGB4()`, `SetAPen()`, and `WritePixel()`. That lets `rt3.c` continue to call Amiga-named functions instead of being rewritten around SDL directly.

SDL3 is used only behind that compatibility layer. CMake builds the original `.c` files as C++ source and links SDL3 through vcpkg manifest mode.

By default, CMake uses vcpkg manifest mode to acquire SDL3. To use an SDL3 package already installed on the system, configure with `-DJUGGLER_USE_VCPKG=OFF` and ensure SDL3 is discoverable through the usual CMake package paths.

### Necessary Code Changes

The original code was written for a K&R-dialect compiler (it's not clear to me whether it was Manx/Aztec or Lattice/SAS). That dialect had different conventions about function prototyping than modern compilers allow.

A number of defines and type definitions (structures) were coalesced into `rt.h` as well, which were duplicated between `rt1.c` and `rt2.c`. This is probably the most controversial change, as it could have been omitted, but I felt it was the right thing to do.

Some static casts and explicit returns were added to appease compiler warnings or errors.

Some standard includes like `math.h`, `stdio.h` and `stdlib.h` were added.

Some lines that were not-quite-blank (consisting only of some invisible whitespace) were replaced with fully blank lines.

At all times, every effort was made to minimize unnecessary changes to the code.

### HAM color handling

The original display code targets Amiga HAM mode. The port keeps the original palette allocation and HAM pixel selection logic in `rt3.c`. Doing so is kind of complicated, because the logic of interpreting how the 6-bitplane HAM/6 mode worked were actually implemented in the Amiga Denise display hardware and its palette DAC.

When `rt3.c` calls `SetAPen()` and `WritePixel()`, the emulation library stores the 6-bit HAM pen value in a secondary buffer. It then interprets that value into an RGB display buffer using the previous pixel on the scanline, matching the way HAM modifies red, green, or blue from the preceding pixel. Caution -- this emulation only works when all pixels to the LEFT of the currently-written one on the scanline have been written and resolved. This is fine because this raytracing loop scans each row left to right, but would need some fancier work if you wanted a full HAM/6 emulation function.

Palette values are treated as Amiga-style 4-bit DAC values and expanded to 8-bit display values by multiplying by 17. This keeps the preview tied to the color precision of the original display mode rather than silently treating palette entries as full 24-bit color.

### Preview window

The SDL window displays the rendered HAM buffer as a live preview. The raytracer still renders the same logical pixel grid that the original code requests. The SDL layer only changes how those pixels are presented on a modern screen.

The preview uses nearest-neighbor scaling so the low-resolution pixels remain sharp. It also applies a non-square-pixel presentation to better match Amiga NTSC low-resolution output. A 320 by 200 logical image is displayed as 640 by 480, and the lower-resolution skipped render preview uses the same display aspect.

The preview remains open at the end of the render until the user closes it or presses a normal character key, Escape, or Enter. Modifier and system keys are ignored so actions such as Alt+Print Screen do not close the window.

### Result

The result is a small SDL-backed Amiga display shim rather than a rewrite of the display code. The original renderer still computes pixels, `rt3.c` still chooses HAM pens and writes pixels through Amiga-style calls, and the compatibility layer translates those calls into a modern SDL3 window.

This keeps the modernized source close to the original published files while making the program buildable and visible on current desktop systems.

### Remaining issues

There's some kind of race condition in the SDL3/HAM/present() emulation code that causes some lower scan rows to be black on some runs. I haven't been able to track down the cause yet, but it seems to be related to the way the output buffer is being updated and written during the render loop. It seems to possibly be a race condition involving the event pump and present and things. I didn't dedicate the effort to fixing it yet.


## AI/LLM Disclosure

AI/LLM tools were used extensively for the portability-modernization work on this project (basically all of the SDL and emulation changes since the original Graham code).

This is because this is a non-commercial passion project with no intellectual property rights, and no revenue, and it's not currently cost-effective for me to contribute the extensive hours required to engineer and test a partial Amiga platform emulator in SDL3. I already did that work by hand in my Brian Wagner AmigaWorld Raytracer porting blog series ( https://alphapixeldev.com/tag/amigaworld-raytracer/ ) and didn't feel like doing it over again slightly differently this time. It was fun the first time but would be tedious this time, so I used AI tools to basically copy my own earlier work and make it look like I didn't copy myself. ;)

None of this was one-shot "Hey, fix this" prompting, I personally planned and wrote extensive guides about how I wanted the work done, and reviewed, revised and corrected the tool-generated output according to my own goals.

Because this is a project for history and education, I anticipate continuing to use AI/LLM coding tools for future phases to maximize benefit while managing resource cost.

## Future

I will catalog additional work I've done with this code in this repository in the future. I have a WebGPU version of it that's kind of interesting, and also am interested in re-creating some of the lost functionality (actually tracing the included dat files and pixel-perfect reverse engineering the animated Juggler exactly).
